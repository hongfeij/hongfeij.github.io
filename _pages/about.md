<!-- A total failure trying to leave some traces in the world. -->

Hi! I’m Hongfei, an independent researcher. I'm interested in **human-AI interaction beyond graphic user interfaces**. My current research explores **how human-AI communication influences and integrates into embodied activities in daily life, work, and play**. I'm also eager to connect the societal perspective I developed through my architecture background to questions about **how AI can shape the future of embodied work**.

    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
      I previously worked with Professor [Dina El Zanfaly](https://www.design.cmu.edu/profiles/dina-el-zanfaly) from the School of Design in the [EM]BODIED COMPUTATIONS LAB (https://embodiedcomputations.org/) on AI-XR for welding training and ceramic making. During my master’s thesis at the School of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University, I was advised by Professor [Daragh Byrne](http://daraghbyrne.me/) and [Sinan Goral](https://www.sinangoral.com/). My thesis focused on LLM hallucination in embodied media, and I earned a Master of Science in Computational Design. Currently, I am collaborating with postdoctoral fellow [Georgie Qiao Jin](http://georgiejin.com/) at Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) on research exploring AI in children’s physical activity play.

    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
      My broader research area lies in <strong>Design</strong> in <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong>. I focus on <strong>embodied interaction</strong> and <strong>human-AI communication</strong>, drawing on insights from <strong>cognitive science</strong> to reflect on the design process, and applying <strong>design methodologies</strong> such as Research-through-Design and Speculative Design. I design and build artifacts, and also conduct qualitative studies.

      [Beyond Research]

    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
      I’m on an arduous journey to complete my master’s degree in Computer Science (Interactive Intelligence) at Georgia Tech, aiming to deepen my technical understanding of AI. At the same time, I’m searching for a decent job to support myself and working toward professional-level fluency in French. With very limited time beyond my (full-time job), studies, language learning, and research (and wondering when I will burn out), I try to stay healthy through regular exercise and nourish my soul with music and films. I’m also considering picking up my palette again, learning an instrument for improvisational music, and engaging in volunteer work to give back to my community.

Yes, I’m currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Spring 2026 and Fall 2026. If you want to know more about my work as a designer, please visit <a href="https://www.hongfeiji.com" target="_blank">[my website]</a>.

Social media can be volatile over time, so I'm currently building a personal blog site for documentation. Stay tuned :)
